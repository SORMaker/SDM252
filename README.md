# SDM252 Laboratory Repository

This repository contains the laboratory code for the SDM252 course. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week's laboratory work contained in its own directory:

```
SDM252/
|── assignment/   # Assignments
|── quiz-tool/    # Quiz tool
├── week2/        # Week 2 laboratory code
├── week3/        # Week 3 laboratory code
├── week4/        # Week 4 laboratory code
├── week5/        # Week 5 laboratory code
├── week6/        # Week 6 laboratory code
├── week7/        # Week 7 laboratory code
├── ...           # Future weeks will be added here
├── .gitignore    # Git ignore file
├── LICENSE       # License file
└── README.md     # This README document
```

## Contents

Each week's directory contains:
- Source code files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
- Compilation files (e.g., makefile)
- laboratory assignment questions(All answers are generated by Gemini ^_^ )

## Usage

To compile and run the code for a specific week, navigate to that week's directory and use the provided compilation instructions (typically using the makefile).\
For example, to work with the code from Week 2:
```
cd week2
# you can use make to compile the code

make

# you can use make run to run the code

make run

# you can use make clean to clean the compiled files

make clean

# the following commands are only available in week2
# you can use make assemble to assemble the code and the .s file will be stored in build folder

make assemble

# you can use make preprocess to preprocess the code and the .i file will be stored in build folder

make preprocess
```
## quiz-tool

quiz-tool is a tool that can help you to select random questions from a question file.

You can use the following command to run the quiz-tool:

```
cd quiz-tool
python3 main.py questions.txt
```
